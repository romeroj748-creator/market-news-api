The Treasury Department has periodically asked investors about the idea of selling ultra-long bonds with maturities beyond 30 years.

For the week, however, the Dow finished 1.5% lower, the S&P 500 ended down 1%, while the Nasdaq retreated 0.8%. The Dow marked its eighth move of at least 1% so far this month, the most 1% moves since December 2018 when it had 12, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Investors will be looking for guidance from central-bank policy makers next week when Federal Reserve officials are slated to meet at the Jackson Hole symposium on Thursday, a day after minutes from the Fed's July 31 policy gathering is released. This past week was marked by heightened anxieties about a domestic recession after the 10-year Treasury rate  fell below that of the 2-year Treasury note  briefly on Wednesday, a condition that has been an accurate predictor of economic recessions in the months after the so-called yield-curve inversion takes place.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

                  "content": "<p>Shares of CyrusOne Inc. , a date center real estate investment trust, rose more than 8% Friday, after a Bloomberg report that the company is exploring a sale after drawing takeover interest. The news sent rivals higher with QTS Realty Trust Inc.  up 3.3%, Digital Realty Trust  up 2.7%, CoreSite Realty Corp.  up 2.9% and Equinix Inc.  up 1%. Wells Fargo analysts said the report is likely true and there is a reasonable probability the company will be taken private by a group of private infrastructure investors. Among the reasons that a take-private deal would make sense for CyrusOne is that investors have been paying premiums for hyperscale assets compared with where they would trade in public markets, the analysts wrote in a note to clients. They tend to take a longer-term investment horizon and are less focused on quarter-to-quarter volatility and could lever up the company to enable it more aggressively expand in Europe and other international markets, said the note. \"On the other hand, CONE itself has noted that large hyperscale customers prefer to work with other public companies and that their access to public capital should open up dramatically once they get a second investment-grade rating,\" they said. CyrusOne is trading at abut 19 times Wells Fargo's next twelve month EBITDA estimate, which compares with Digital Realty's acquisition of REIT DuPont Fabros Technology , which came at a roughly 20 times multiple. \"CyrusOne  in many ways deserves a premium over DuPont Fabros given it has a strategic international platform, less customer concentration than DFT (which had a large pending rent roll-down with Facebook) and a more diversified business model,\" said the note. \"On the other hand, this would be an acquisition of significant size for a private infrastructure consortium, which could merit a slight discount (for instance, ZAYO sold at a notable discount to many smaller-scale fiber assets).\"  CyrusOne shares have gained 32% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 15%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

But the company's setting aside of a C$6.4 million provision against oil and gelcaps being returned due to oversupply may be a company-specific problem, said Macdonell. The analyst calculated that 23% of the company's third-quarter and 50% of its fourth-quarter recreational market volumes were extract products, while extracts accounted for an average of 7% of the sell-through volume in the recreational market since inception. \"We are decreasing our price target as the lacklustre performance in recreational market sales could\r\nindicate that Canopy has lost the leading position,\" he wrote in a note. \"We remain positive on WEED over the long-term as we expect the company is well prepared for cannabis 2.0.,\" he said, referring to the launch of new formats including edibles later this year. Canopy shares were up 2% premarket, but have fallen 17% this week and 39% in three months.

Moline, Ill.-based Deere said it had net income of $899 million, or $2.81 a share, in the quarter to July 28, compared with $910 million, or $2.78 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $2.71, below the $2.83 FactSet consensus. Sales fell 3% to $10.036 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $9.407 billion. \"John Deere's third-quarter results reflected the high degree of uncertainty that continues to overshadow the agricultural sector,\" Chief Executive Samuel R. Allen said in a statement. \"Concerns about export-market access, near-term demand for commodities such as soybeans, and overall crop conditions, have caused many farmers to postpone major equipment purchases. At the same time, general economic conditions remain positive and are contributing to strong results for Deere's construction and forestry business.\" The company is expecting company equipment sales to rise about 4% in fiscal 2019. Net sales and revenues are expected to rise about 5%, while net income is expected to come to about $3.2 billion. Shares have fallen 3.7% in 2019, while the S&P 500  has gained 13.6%. \r\n</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

                  "content": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell to its Thursday low in afternoon trade as the market digested reports about coming monetary-policy action out of Europe. The Wall Street Journal reported that the European Central Bank was readying a package of stimulus measures at its next policy meeting in September that should exceed investors' expectations. The 10-year Treasury note  yielded 1.48%, representing a fresh three-year low for the benchmark bond. Bond prices rise as yields fall. The WSJ reported that Olli Rehn, who sits on the ECB's rate-setting committee as the head of Finland's central bank, said the slowing global economy would see Europe's central bank roll stimulus measures that should include \"substantial and sufficient\" bond purchases as well as cuts to the bank's key interest rate. The comments come as the market has been rattled by worries about a global economic recession, heightened by a so-called yield-curve inversion, where the 2-year Treasury note has risen above the 10-year for the first time in more than a decade. The Dow, most recently, was down 100 points, or 0.4%, at 25,380, while the S&P 500 index  declined 0.4% at 2,831, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  retreating 0.6% at 7,724.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The 10-year Treasury note yield  fell 8.4 basis points to 1.497%. The 2-year note yield  was down 9.8 basis points to 1.479%, while the 30-year bond yield  slipped 8.7 basis points to 1.940%. Debt prices move in the opposite direction of yields. Bond yields accelerated their mid-morning slide as comments from European Central Bank policymaker Olli Rehn raised the prospect of a more aggressive package of stimulus measures at the ECB's September meeting. His comments helped draw investors into European debt. The German 10-year government bond yield  slipped 5.4 basis points to a negative 0.706%. The 10-year Italian bond yield  plunged 19.3 basis points to 1.334%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
